## How to Run

This project consists of a frontend and a backend part, which are explained below on how to run them.

### Frontend

1. Open a terminal (or Command Prompt).
2. Navigate to the root directory of the project.
3. From the root directory, enter the `static` folder. Make sure to directly enter the `static` folder without opening its parent folder.
4. Open the `index.html` file with a browser. If you have a local server capable of serving static files, you may also use it to serve the `index.html`.

### Backend

1. Ensure Python is installed on your machine and that it meets the project's requirements.
2. Open a terminal (or Command Prompt).
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `DataSetConnect.py` file.
4. Run the following command to start the backend service:

```bash
python DataSetConnect.py
```

Ensure both the frontend and backend are running on the local 8848 port. This might require setting the port in the `DataSetConnect.py` file or in your frontend configuration accordingly.

## Accessing the Application

Access `http://localhost:8848` in your browser to view the application. Make sure both frontend and backend services are up and running.
